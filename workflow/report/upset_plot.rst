Here, we show an example (with a single combination of "Sample attributes" as specified in the config file) of overlap of unique variants across time points and replicates.
Only the combinations corresponding to >1% of all unique variants are shown.
In a "standard" DMS experiment, we typically observe a strong overlap between input (T0) replicates.
The stacked barplot indicates the number of variants labeled "high confidence" ("1", >= 10 reads per variant in all input replicates), "medium" confidence ("2", >= 10 reads per variant in at least 1 input replicate) or "low confidence" ("3").
If you are running the workflow on the provided example dataset, it is normal to observe a large number of "low confidence" variants.
The plot above indicates the average read count in the input.
