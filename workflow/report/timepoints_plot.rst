Here, we show an example of correlation between output time points for a single combination of "Samples attributes" and a single replicate.
Diagonal plots show the distribution of values according to the confidence score (which informs on the read count in the input).
If you ran the workflow on the example dataset, or if your dataset does not contain more than 1 output time point, the figure should consist of a single diagonal (density) plot.
