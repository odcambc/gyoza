Here, we show the evolution of selection coefficients through time depending on the type of mutation.
This is relevant mostly if your dataset contains more than 1 output time point, but even with only one you could potentially discern patterns related to the mutation type.
For the example dataset, we typically observe higher selection coefficients for nonsense variants, and values around 0 for synonymous variants.
With a bigger dataset and multiple output time points, you can see the spread of values for each type of mutation.
